<title>AWS: exploring Elastic Beanstalk - Cloud Platform Engineering, or something approaching it.</title>

<meta name="description" content="After 4 years building Service Fabric platforms, Containers have been noise that I&amp;rsquo;ve heard, but not really understood. Which means they were the first thing to dabble in when I found some free time in lockdown.
I started out with the excellent Docker Deep Dive book by Nigel Poulton though I found it on offer at LeanPub.
I&amp;rsquo;m probably still only half of the way through this book, but decided it was time to try out some of the knowledge." />

        <p>After 4 years building Service Fabric platforms, Containers have been noise that I&rsquo;ve heard, but not really understood. Which means they were the first thing to dabble in when I found some free time in lockdown.</p>
<p>I started out with the excellent <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Docker-Deep-Dive-Nigel-Poulton/dp/1521822808/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=docker+deep+dive&amp;qid=1589790965&amp;sr=8-1">Docker Deep Dive</a> book by <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Docker-Deep-Dive-Nigel-Poulton/dp/1521822808/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=docker+deep+dive&amp;qid=1589790965&amp;sr=8-1">Nigel Poulton</a> though I found it on offer at <a href="https://leanpub.com/dockerdeepdive">LeanPub</a>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m probably still only half of the way through this book, but decided it was time to try out some of the knowledge.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve repurposed the Flask App in this <a href="https://docker-curriculum.com/">tutorial</a> which shows originally, random cat gifs. My version which can be found <a href="https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/bytejunkie77/carpics">here</a>, shows pictures of Modified German cars, which is a bit of a passion of mine.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also uploaded the container app to Elastic Container Registry in another blog post here.</p>
<p>To the point of this post, <a href="https://github.com/bytejunkie/tf-aws-eba">here</a> is a boilerplate repo which creates an Elastic Beanstalk app. it also creates all the pre-requisites.</p>
<ul>
<li>IAM Role to allow the EC2 instance to write log files</li>
<li>IAM policy to attach to the above</li>
<li>IAM Instance Profile to pull the above two items together</li>
<li>The Elastic Beanstalk application, and version.</li>
<li>The Elastic Beanstalk Environment and Configuration Template, to create the instance on a certain ami.</li>
</ul>
<p>These templates should be reasonably reusable, there is a readme with details of the secrets to create.</p>
<h3 id="things-to-note">Things to note</h3>
<p>There is a data object in <em>main.tf</em> which refers to a zip file of the application. From the Terraform Provider <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/r/elastic_beanstalk_application_version.html">docs</a> it doesnt look like it is possible to deploy from a git repo yet, which is a shame. Essentially, you&rsquo;re asking EB to read a json file to work out what to deploy. But it needs to be in a zip file.</p>
<pre><code>data &quot;aws_s3_bucket_object&quot; &quot;carpics&quot; {
  bucket = &quot;carpics-deploy&quot;
  key    = &quot;source/carpics.zip&quot;
}
</code></pre>
